# AI Coder: Text-Based Adventure Game

This text-based adventure game leverages the power of AI throughout the development process, enhancing every aspect of the game's creation. With the aid of AI tools, we aim to streamline our workflow, optimize code generation, and create an immersive gaming experience for players.

## AI-Powered Development

We have harnessed the capabilities of AI in almost every stage of the game's development process. From brainstorming creative storylines to generating code, documentation, and tests, AI tools have played a vital role in optimizing our workflow and enhancing our productivity. The key AI tools used in this project include:

- OpenAI ChatGPT (3.5): Assisted in brainstorming ideas, creating code outlines, generating documentation, and providing suggestions during development.
- Github Copilot: Helped with auto-filling code and providing intelligent code completion.
- Poe: An AI model utilized for generating ASCII art, assisting in designing the room system, implementing the inventory system, designing additional required verbs, and optimizing interactions between characters.

The integration of AI in our development process has allowed us to tackle complex tasks more efficiently, freeing up time for creative problem-solving and enhancing the overall quality of the game.

## Installation and Usage

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-coder.git`
2. Create your own virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
3. Run your own virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
5. Run the game: `python main.py`

Please note that this is a terminal and text-based game.

## Capstone Project

This project serves as our capstone project for our computer science post-baccalaureate program. As part of the AI Coder project, we chose to develop a text-based adventure game and document the entire development process while utilizing AI tools. This capstone project represents the culmination of our studies and showcases our skills in game development, AI integration, and project management.

Throughout this project, we will provide detailed documentation of our progress, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using AI in game development. By combining our knowledge of computer science principles, game design, and AI technologies, we aim to create a compelling and immersive gaming experience while showcasing the power and potential of AI in programming. Our final deliverable will be a fully functional game, along with a detailed report of our development process. 

## Game Description

Our game, "Porktopia: The Laser Menace", is a post-apocalyptic text adventure game set in the world of Porktopia. Genetic experiments have gone awry, resulting in the creation of laser-wielding pig mutants who have plunged the land into chaos. As a survivor stumbling upon a secret resistance group, your mission is to help the resistance eliminate the pig mutants and restore peace to Porktopia.

The game features a captivating storyline divided into four acts. Explore various locations, encounter mutated creatures, and solve puzzles as you progress through the game. Acquire objects, unlock rooms, and unravel the mysteries of the pig mutants' origins. Your choices and actions throughout the game will shape the outcome and lead to different endings, providing replayability and depth to the gameplay experience.
